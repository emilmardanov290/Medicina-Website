# Hospital Website

This project is based on an open-source HTML and CSS template, which I adapted to build a professional hospital and medical services website. The goal was to practice front-end development by customizing an existing template to create a functional, visually appealing, and patient-friendly website.

## Features

- Custom layout, colors, and typography for a hospital theme
- Sections for departments, doctor profiles, patient resources, and health tips
- Fully responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile
- Clean and maintainable HTML and CSS code
- Interactive elements with CSS hover effects and transitions

## Learning Outcomes

- Working with reusable components and modular styling
- Simplifying and cleaning up code for readability and maintainability
- Applying design principles to convey professionalism and trust
- Improving responsive design skills and user experience
